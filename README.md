# Introduction 
Useful (most of) extensions (most of)
Not use extensions at all, use DI instead. We heavily use https://autofac.org/
Nevertheless, 'outsourced' as well tested and maintained package, we use it within several projects.

# Extensions
*Certificate
*Compare
*Filter
*Log
*Merge
*Reflection
*Task

# Maintenance
As we use this package in multiple projects, our goal is to keep code and references up to to very regularly.
