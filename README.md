# Introduction 
* Useful (most of) extensions (most of).
* Alert: Not use extensions at all, use DI instead. We heavily use https://autofac.org/.
* Nevertheless, 'outsourced' as well tested and maintained package, we use it within several projects.

# Extensions
* Certificate
* Compare
* Filter
* Log
* Merge
* Reflection
* Task

# Comments
Once you write a comment, it's obsolete.
We think comments is useless metadata robbing developers time, which can better be used to write clean code, not need any metadata to be understandable.

# Maintenance
As we use this package in multiple projects, our goal is to keep code and references up to date very regularly.
