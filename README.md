# Introduction 
Although using extensions methods contradicts to DI container (bizcon heavily uses https://autofac.org/), it's usage could save great development time in certain circumstances / phases.
The more, the better maintained and tested these shared assemblies are...

# Extensions
* Certificate (System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2)
* Compare (System.Object)
* Filter (System.Object)
* Log (System.Object)
* Merge (System.Object)
* Reflection (System.Object)
* Task (System.Threading.Tasks.Task and suitable)

# Comments
Once a comment is written, it's obsolete!
Comments is useless metadata robbing developers time, which can better be used to write clean code, not need any metadata to be understood.

# Maintenance
As we use this package in multiple projects, our goal is to keep code and referenced assembly versions up to date regularly.
